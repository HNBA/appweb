`sb-admin-bs4-angular4` provides the following features:
- Developed using boostrap-v4.0.0-alpha.6
- Following the best practices.
- Ahead-of-Time compilation support.
- Official Angular i18n support.
- Production and development builds.
- Ahead-of-Time compilation support.
- Tree-Shaking production builds.

### How to start
**Note** that this seed project requires  **node >=v6.9.0 and npm >=3**.

In order to start the project use:

# :bell: Internship project - Monitoring - OSS

The project's aim is to monitor different components based on logs readability. By providing an architecture based on logs readibility, this solution tends to be universal. From a pratical point of view, the purpose of the solution is to be alerted through a mobile and web app in case of a component failure. 

This project use three-key components as backend : 
-  Elasticsearch for storing data (logs, alerts)
-  Elastalert which is a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, or other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch
-  NodeJS for hosting the website but also for handling requests for the web apps and the mobile apps

This repo contains :
- :memo: the ansible script that enables any user to deploy the architecture in a one shot act
- :earth_africa: the web app
- :iphone: the android app
- :triangular_ruler: the architecture documentation

:books:
For **configuration**, **deployment** and **user guide** there is a **wiki** available [here](https://github.com/Carrefour-Group/dashboard-run/wiki).


# :exclamation: Troubleshooting 

Often times things goes wrong due to network connection or target host
load, so a simple retry will be successful. Otherwise activate verbose
execution see the logs and limit the execution to the failing tasks
role. If errors persists contact the projet_oss@carrefour.com team.
